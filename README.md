Deep Knowledge Tracing

This implementation is based off of work by Chris Piech, adapted from a dkt LSTM model from the 'Going Deeper with Deep Knowledge Tracing' paper by Xiong et al.

It has been adapted to take as inputs course engagement covariates from a MOOC we have data for.  Permission was received from the original author to make our work available under the GNU GPLv3.
